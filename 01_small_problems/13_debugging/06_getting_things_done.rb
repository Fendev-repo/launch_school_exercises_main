  We wrote a method for moving a given number of elements from one array to another. We decide to test it on our todo list, but invoking move on line 11 results in a SystemStackError. What does this error mean and why does it happen?
=end


def move(n, from_array, to_array)
  to_array << from_array.slice!(0, 2)
  to_array.flatten!
end

# Example

todo = ['study', 'walk the dog', 'coffee with Tom']
done = ['apply sunscreen', 'go to the beach']

move(2, todo, done)

p todo == ['coffee with Tom']
p done == ['apply sunscreen', 'go to the beach', 'study', 'walk the dog']
