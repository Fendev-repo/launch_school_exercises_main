=begin
  Write a program that prompts the user for two positive integers, and then prints the results of the following operations on those two numbers: addition, subtraction, product, quotient, remainder, and power. Do not worry about validating the input.
  
  ==> Enter the first number:
  23
  ==> Enter the second number:
  17
  ==> 23 + 17 = 40
  ==> 23 - 17 = 6
  ==> 23 * 17 = 391
  ==> 23 / 17 = 1
  ==> 23 % 17 = 6
  ==> 23 ** 17 = 141050039560662968926103
