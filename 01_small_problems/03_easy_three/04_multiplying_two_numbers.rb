# Create a method that takes two arguments, multiplies them together, and returns the result.
# Further Exploration
# For fun: what happens if the first argument is an Array? What do you think is happening here?


def multiply(num_one, num_two)
  num_one * num_two
end

# puts multiply(5, 3) == 15

# The array is simply being multiplied and the expression if being
# puts to the terminal.
# puts multiply([1,2,3], 3)
